What is an Observable:
    A data source. User inputs, http requests, code triggers, etc.
    As a publisher, you create an Observable instance that defines a subscriber function. This is the function that is executed when a consumer calls the subscribe() method. The subscriber function defines how to obtain or generate values or messages to be published.

To execute the observable you have created and begin receiving notifications, you call its subscribe() method,
passing an observer. This is a JavaScript object that defines the handlers for the notifications you receive. 
The subscribe() call returns a Subscription object that has an unsubscribe() method, which you call to stop 
receiving notifications.
